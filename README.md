In this project, we develop a medical decision support system for disease diagnosis using data science methodologies. 

The chosen dataset is sourced from publicly available medical datasets, and the basic steps of machine learning model creation are followed. Starting with data collection, cleaning and preprocessing, the classification model development follows, and finally there is the evaluation of the modelâ€™s performance using standard metrics.
